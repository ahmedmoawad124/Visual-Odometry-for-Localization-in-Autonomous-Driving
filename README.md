Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving | openCV

- Extract features from the photographs taken with a camera setup on the vehicle.
- Use the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs.
- Use the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs.
- Use the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory.
